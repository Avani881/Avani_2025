Aim-Write a program that takes two strings representing numbers, converts them to wrapper classes, and performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
CODE-
import java.util.Scanner;

public class SimpleArithmetic {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.print("Enter the first number: ");
        String num1 = scanner.nextLine();

        System.out.print("Enter the second number: ");
        String num2 = scanner.nextLine();

        Float number1 = Float.valueOf(num1);
        Float number2 = Float.valueOf(num2);

        System.out.println("Addition: " + (number1 + number2));
        System.out.println("Subtraction: " + (number1 - number2));
        System.out.println("Multiplication: " + (number1 * number2));
        System.out.println("Division: " + (number2 != 0 ? (number1 / number2) : "Cannot divide by zero"));

        scanner.close();
    }
}

OUTPUT-
Enter the first number: 10
Enter the second number: 2
Addition: 12.0
Subtraction: 8.0
Multiplication: 20.0
Division: 5.0
